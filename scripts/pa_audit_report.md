# Print Assumptions 全量批审计报告（pa_audit）

- 生成时间：2026-09-11 02:18:55 +0800；总耗时：4847s（含 guard 热等待 85s（按 guard cooling 行计数 × CoolSec=5 估算））
- 脚本：scripts/pa_audit.sh（SHA1 `94ccaf54da059e3a04ea7bafd2d2a2533fdb9720`）；清单：scripts/pa_theorems.txt（193 条）
- 工具链：The Rocq Prover, version 9.0.1（Windows 走 9.0 完整路径 `C:/Rocq-Platform~9.0~2025.08/bin`，禁裸 PATH——9.1 coqchk 对 9.0 产物报 bad version 90001；CI ubuntu 走 setup 的 9.0）
- root：ConstructiveWorld_vo（/d/ComplexAnalysis/ConstructiveWorld-Main/ConstructiveWorld_vo）；guard：LoadLimit=60 / CoreN=3（cpu_guard.ps1，root 外既定件）

## 总判定

- **Closed 193 / Fail 0 / EXEMPT(避让) 0，共 193 条**；覆盖模块 89 个（基座 CW_ConstructiveWorld_219 ＋ scripts/order.txt 全部 ＋ 清单所涉在树模块；避让剔除：UpMinP UpIDL ）
- 零承认 grep（行首口径 `Axiom|Admitted|Parameter|Conjecture|Abort`）：**89 个源文件扫描，命中 0**

## 编译动作（.vo 缺失或旧于 .v 方编译；一律 guard 包装 + 9.0 显式路径）

- 新编译 0：无
- 编译失败 1：UpReqTempInterp 
- 免编复用（.vo 不旧于 .v）88
- 避让未编（合并轨收口席修复中，跳编跳查）：UpMinP UpIDL

## coqchk 汇总

coqchk（Rocq 9.0 工具链，-silent -o 输出假设清单；owner 模块合并单趟：CW_ConstructiveWorld_219,UpCS,UpQKBound,UpArchAttn,UpEvictId,UpKVDrift,CW220_Extensions,UpDebtGibbsT,UpReqAlign,UpReqAlign3,UpReqDist,UpReqTempEntropy,UpSigMigrate,UpReqFEPAttn,UpReqGeomD,UpReqDpoLoss,UpRealLeB,UpReqPPOPlain）：**PASS**（rc=0；成功行被 -silent 抑制，以 -o 假设清单段在场判定）。环境 Axioms 段条目数：3——`Stdlib.Logic.FunctionalExtensionality.functional_extensionality_dep`、`Stdlib.Reals.ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_not_dec`、`Stdlib.Reals.ClassicalDedekindReals.sig_forall_dec`——均为 Stdlib 侧 axiom（经 Stdlib 内部传递链装入环境），非本库声明；本库 193 条逐件 Print Assumptions 全 Closed（见逐定理表），即被审常量对其零依赖。判定式与 9.0 -silent 行为差异及 Axioms 段原文见 scripts/_pa_work/coqchk_combined.log（log 尾 guard powershell 之 SetConsoleWindowTitle 无控制台异常为无害噪音，已从本节剔除）。

## 零承认 grep（行首口径）

- 扫描范围：覆盖集内 89 个 .v（词表：`^[[:space:]]*(Axiom|Admitted|Parameter|Conjecture|Abort)\b`；避让件不在扫）
- **命中 0**（与 attn\G1全库合规自查-20260910.md 的 L1 层 34/34 FAIL=0、《零公理审计口径说明》L1 一致）

## 漂移清单（论文-库命名漂移，逐条在案、不跳过）

| 论文名 | 库内现状 | 判定 |
|---|---|---|
| req_step_kl_eta_bound（论文1 §4.3.2 批3 同位桥件名） | 仓库树与 attn 均无此声明 | 命名漂移/待入库；近邻已入清单：real_step_kl_eta_bound_eps（基座219）、geod_step_kl_eta_bound_eps（UpReqGeomD） |
| r2_step_kl_weighted（论文1 UpReqAlign3 六件清单名） | 库内无声明 | 命名漂移；近邻 r2_step_kl_rearr（UpReqAlign3） |
| rppo_align_objective_advantage_decomp（论文1 快照锚，UpReqPPO） | 仓库树无；仅 attn 工作区在盘 | 轮 9 待入库面（非命名漂移），入库后补审 |
| attention_minimizes_free_energy（论文2 概念名） | 库内声明为 req_attention_minimizes_free_energy_unique（UpReqFEPAttn） | 已按库内正名入清单 |
| tv_doeblin_contraction / tv_doeblin_iter（论文2 定理 5.10） | 库内无声明（UpTVReal 存档件未并入模块化树） | 存档件未并入/命名漂移；双点 TV 收缩以基座 attention_tv_contraction 族与 UpReqSampling bounded_softmax_tv 族承载 |
| real_kl_sum_decomp（论文2 §Real 复刻清单定理 4.1 侧名） | 基座 .v 注释幻影：L43735 重复注释头嵌套未闭、定理文本被吞，.vo 零导出（CW214KL_scan 垫片同构同判） | 非真实声明（注释幻影），不入清单；承 probe_full.v 历史注记同判；定理 4.1 主承载 free_energy_kl_decomp 已入清单。论文侧引用该名处建议 camera-ready 前对表 |

## 覆盖边界（如实登记）

- **UpIDL / UpMinP：已知预存缺陷修复中（合并轨收口席），跳编跳查，修复入库后补审计**（本次 EXEMPT 口径；coqchk 合并趟环境内含其既有 .vo 属只读加载，非对其重认证）。
- UpReqTempInterp（order.txt 在列）：编译失败（coqc 类型错位，cauchy_real_exp 项；.vo 不存在，.v 为 2026-09-10 08:08 版）——非清单 owner、无 PA 探针定理，逐定理结果不受影响；零承认 grep 已含该文件（命中 0）；如实登记，修复入库后随全树重跑补覆盖。
- **attn 工作区轮 9 新件待入库后重跑**：attn 侧较新版本（2026-09-10 版 UpAuditBridge/UpBudgetReal/UpCLQuery/UpDPOLip/UpDebtGibbsT/UpDebtSqrtAbs 等、UpReqPPO 之 rppo_align_objective_advantage_decomp）未入库，不在本报告覆盖；入库后重跑本脚本即得全量新口径。
- UpReqAlign3.v、UpAlignIdReq.v 在仓库树有源有 .vo 但未列入 order.txt：前者为清单 owner 已并入覆盖，后者无清单定理未逐一探针（零承认 grep 已含）。
- CW214KL_scan.v / AttnHardLimit218.v 为基座内容只读垫片件（order.txt 在列、随编译面覆盖），其与基座重名系历史垫片设计；无清单定理取自该两件。
- req_free_energy_kl_decomp 在 UpReqDist/UpSigMigrate/UpSigMigrate2/CW220_Extensions 四处同名声明、req_attention_is_gibbs_temp 在 UpSigMigrate/CW220_Extensions 两处：清单取论文交付正名模块（UpReqDist / UpSigMigrate）；探针逐模块隔离 Require，无歧义。

## 谱系与复现

- 定理清单承 `演变\.ablation\sc2_parallel\sL_assumptions\probe_full.v`（81 条，基态 198/206 批量 CLEAN 链）＋论文1/2 头条族补录 85 条 ＋ req 系旗舰 27 条；断言/解析方式承同目录 assert_print_assumptions.ps1 / parse_pa_log.ps1 的 bash 化；负载闸承 `演变\.ablation\cpu_guard.ps1`（LoadLimit 与在飞席热并发自调）。
- 复现：仓库根执行 `bash scripts/pa_audit.sh --coqchk`（复用现成 .vo 可加 `--no-build`）。旁证 log 全量在 scripts/_pa_work/。
- 与旧基线差值：81 条旧口径（基态 198/206 CLEAN）→ 本报告 193 条；基座由单文件 198/206 迁至 219 模块树（`ConstructiveWorld_vo`，基座 CW_ConstructiveWorld_219 ＋ Up* 模块），旧口径 81 条全部保留并逐条重跑。
